## `stencila/style` : Stencila's visual design resources and style guide

This is the place for Stencila's visual design resources (e.g. CSS, icons, logos) and [style guide](https://stencila.github.io/style/guide). The resources here are resused across a number of other repositores including the main application interfaces ([`stencila/stencila`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila)), the hub ([`stencila/hub`](https://github.com/stencila/hub)) and documentation sites ([`stencila/docket`](https://github.com/stencila/docket)).

To get started with development, clone this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stencila/style.git
```

Then install the necessary Node packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Build SASS into CSS using the `watch` NPM script:

```bash
npm run watch
```

In a separate console, run the local server to view the style guide, including examples, in your browser and `Crtl+R` to refresh when you make changes:

```bash
npm run serve
```
